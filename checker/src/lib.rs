// In an ideal world there would be a stable well documented set of crates containing a specific
// version of the Rust compiler along with its sources and debug information. We'd then just get
// those from crate.io and merely go on our way as just another Rust application. Rust compiler
// upgrades will be non events for Mirai until it is ready to jump to another release and old
// versions of Mirai will continue to work just as before.
//
// In the current world, however, we have to use the following hacky feature to get access to a
// private and not very stable set of APIs from whatever compiler is in the path when we run Mirai.
// While pretty bad, it is a lot less bad than having to write our own compiler, so here goes.
